### Having issues with adding these packs to MCBE?
###### (This tutorial is for you!)

Let's begin with the basics.
I'm sure you already know how to download these packs.
If you know these, skip to Step 2.

# Step 1
## Downloading the file

`in progress`

# Step 2
## Installing the pack to MCBE

If your OS does *not* support the feature that lets you to open files with specific applications, I suggest you one app that I use to open .mcpack files with Minecraft.
You cannot open files like these in Minecraft. *[research needed]*

I suggest you use [ES File Manager](https://mega.nz/#!9GgBzIjZ!EtjlpLFhIpsUP40SzUuE6ZBJGjr_TJsvxdWNF_n1FRQ) for opening apps with Minecraft.

First, navigate to the Download(s) folder. It's in your local storage.

In this example, I want to open unique dyes resource pack that I have downloaded here.

Tap on it and it should automatically open Minecraft. If it doesn't, then if it asks you to open the file with a specific app, choose Minecraft.

If you see the label above, congratulations! You've successfully installed the pack!

# Step 3
## Using these packs

If you know all of this, this step isn't important. If not, then follow the texts below.

---

Make sure to go to Settings and go to Resource Packs (or Global Packs).

Then go to My Packs and click on that resource pack you've installed. Click on that *sweet* Activate button and you're ready to go!

#### Finishing touchs

If you want to show these sweet resource packs to your friends, go to Play and click on that pencil icon next to the world you want your resource pack to be added in.

Or if you are creating a new world, include the resource pack in!

Go to Resource Packs and you're ready to go! Feel free to mark the tick "require others to install pack" to make it mandatory to install packs (additional step, you don't have to do this :D)
