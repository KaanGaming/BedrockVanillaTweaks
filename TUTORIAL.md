### Having issues with adding these packs to MCBE?
###### (This tutorial is for you!)

Let's begin with the basics.
I'm sure you already know how to download these packs.
If you know these, skip to Step 2.

# Step 1
## Downloading the file

Go to the Code tab in repository site, and scroll down until you see these. Click one of these I have marked, Datapacks are not here yet.

Then, click any of these resource packs you want in your game!
Remember, remove the old ones and replace them with a new one!

They should have downloaded automatically, if not, there should be a download button after the page has loaded. Click it.

# Step 2
## Installing the pack to MCBE

If your OS does *not* support the feature that lets you to open files with specific applications, I suggest you one app that I use to open .mcpack files with Minecraft.
You cannot open files like these in Minecraft. *[research needed]*

I suggest you use [ES File Manager](https://mega.nz/#!9GgBzIjZ!EtjlpLFhIpsUP40SzUuE6ZBJGjr_TJsvxdWNF_n1FRQ) for opening apps with Minecraft.

First, navigate to the Download(s) folder. It's in your local storage.

In this example, I want to open unique dyes resource pack that I have downloaded here.

Tap on it and it should automatically open Minecraft. If it doesn't, then if it asks you to open the file with a specific app, choose Minecraft.

## How to update packs/Uninstall packs

If you have an old pack and want to replace the old one, follow Step 1 again if you haven't and make sure to delete the resource pack as shown in the image.

Go to Settings, Resource Packs then tap on a resource pack you want to uninstall. Tap on the tick and tap Delete.

#### Finishing touchs

If you want to show these sweet resource packs to your friends, go to Play and click on that pencil icon next to the world you want your resource pack to be added in.

Or if you are creating a new world, include the resource pack in!

Go to Resource Packs and you're ready to go! Feel free to mark the tick "require others to install pack" to make it mandatory to install packs (additional step, you don't have to do this :D)
