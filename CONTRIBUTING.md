# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES FOR BedrockVanillaTweaks.
If this is your first time here, there are some things you need to consider.

## 1. Steps for creating a good issue
If you are having some issues with the resource packs;

- Explain what's happening
- Say the version you use
- Include a screenshot if available
  - **A video could help too** if a screenshot doesn't explain anything but the video does.
- Additional information if you got any.

Or if you have a suggestion, do any of these.

- **If you have a suggestion regarding to README.md, TUTORIAL.md or other changes, please explain what changes would you do.**
  - Make issues like these if you don't know how to edit it properly, or too unsure about it.
  - **If you find a typo, you can make an issue about it.** We suggest you might make a pull request out of it. For finding typos, remember to blink regularly! Every blink, you notice everything.
- **If a resource pack is outdated, you might make an issue** or contact the author of the resource pack yourself.
- If you got other suggestions in your sleeves, consider sharing them! They might help our project.

If you have the concerns of nobody answering you, consider mentioning someone that would help you. (A contributor, collaborator, author of the project etc..)

## 2. Steps for creating a good pull request
Got a pull request that adds amazing changes? Excellent! Here are some suggestions on what could you do.

- Explain the changes it would make. Polish README.md, TUTORIAL.md or other markdown files,
- **Fix some typos on specific pages,**
- **Fix a broken or outdated link**
  - **or "update" the pack** (AKA update the link to the pack's latest release),
- **Make some community updates** such as editing community related files.
- **_If you are making your own changes,_** completely make sure you can rely on it! Do not be afraid of no, and when they say that, make sure to thank them and if they have not given guides on what should you do then you could ask them for advices.

## 3. Expected behavior
Here's what kind of behavior we expect from you, or what should you do.
These are the majority of the ideas you should be doing.
###### [If you want a full example of expected behavior from the whole github, click this. \(Community guidelines\)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)

- Refrain from fear of people saying "no". Disagreements and different opinions are a fact of life. Everyone has a variety of ideas they want, and if they got a similar idea but not the exact they may say no. You may criticize ideas, but not people. This will help people feel comfortable discussing with eachother.
- **Don't send an e-mail to someone who you would like help from. (unless it's really private)** You could mention them in the location you want help in, don't keep anything private (again, unless if it's really private)
- **Be clear and stay on topic.** People use GitHub to work together on a project, and to be more productive. It may be little awkward at start, but remember that you are helping them. Off-topic messages are distraction (sometimes welcome, but not usually) from getting work done and being productive.
- **Things you should not be doing are usually,** criticize people (discriminating them by religion, disability, age, name, etc..) or bullying/harassment (aka badgering people for their "mistakes"), threats of violence, impersonation (copying other people's avatar, username, other stuff) to mislead people into unnecessary information, doxxing and invasion of privacy (posting other people's personal information, phone numbers, etc), misinformation, sexually & gratuitously obscene content or active malware or exploits.

#### [What if someone breaks the rules above \(and in GitHub community guidelines\)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines#what-happens-if-someone-breaks-the-rules)

**Take note that the first two bullet items do NOT violate community guidelines! You should recommend them what to do. And if you are unsure about it, [check out the guidelines and read fully to make sure what actions you could take.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)**
Whether it's a comment, issue or whatever, if it contains content breaking GitHub community guidelines (or things they should be not doing usually) you could click the three dotted item on the right side and click on report content. Fill in the details if there are, then you're good to go.

*If you think it's not suitable for reporting but also not suitable for the project, consider mentioning a collaborator or the author of the project so they could delete it, hide it or report it. Always make sure to ask if you are completely unsure about what to do.*
